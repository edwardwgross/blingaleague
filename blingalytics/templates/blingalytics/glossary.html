<h3 id="expected_wins">Expected Wins</h3>
<p>
  Expected wins uses <a href="{% url 'blingalytics.expected_wins' %}">historical game scores</a> to determine a team's odds of winning each game and sums that for all the team's games in a season.  The totals are then adjusted so that the sum of expected wins for all teams in a season equals the total number of games played for the season.
</p>

<h3 id="robscore">RobScore</h3>
<p>

  <ul>
    <li>1 point for making the playoffs</li>
    <li>1 point for winning the Sanderson Cup</li>
    <li>0.5 points for losing in the Blingabowl</li>
    <li>0.25 points for winning the third-place game</li>
    <li>0.5 points for finishing the regular season in first place</li>
    <li>0.25 points for finishing the regular season in second place</li>
  </ul>
